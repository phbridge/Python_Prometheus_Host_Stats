# Title
Python Prometheus Host Stats
 
# Language
Python 3.5+

# Description
This is designed to be an easy way to collect host stats using prometheus scrape as if your are scraping for other stuff
nice and easy to also scrape for this. I got fed up of the different ways telegraf and prometheus reported stuff making
comparisons and graphing on a single page hard work.
If you want to monitor some basic host stats from the hose its self that from other source this is a quick easy way to
add this. I am amazed someone has not done it already but a quick search returned fruitless.

I should probably mention this uses proc/XYZ for grabbing the stats so will only work on OS's that have the proc files :-)
